 Full_Python_Scripts
 This repo holds all my Python applications and projects that I have been working on
 using different modules and the GUI module Tkinter.


Please Enjoy your look around and always feel free to reach out with any questions you may have

Phonebook Application
   This application utilizes tkinter, SQLite3 and a few other modules to create a phonebook and information database
   and GUI.  To begin, run the Phonebook_master_page.py
   
Django Hotel
    This is an ordering website for a hotel to state the food and drink choices they offer to customers.  Items can be added, updated, deleted 
    and read (CRUD) from the local database in order to have an up to date list at all times.  A super user was created at the beginning in order
    to log into the back where the admin of the web page can also use the view functions.
Django Mountain Bike Application
    In this application, the user can store their rides in a data-base based off the django model built.  They can use this model to update their 
    ride information, delete their data or add more data to the ride index.  Connecting to the API from MTB project, a user can search local trails
    in their area to ride.  Using Beautiful Soup, the user can check on up to date news and gear reviews from Pink Bike.
